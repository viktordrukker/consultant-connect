# Go-To-Market and Development Strategy

This section captures how we plan to launch the product, attract
users and keep development lean.

## Target Market
- Startup founders and small businesses needing ad-hoc expertise.
- Independent consultants looking for leads and secure payments.

## Acquisition Channels
- Content marketing (blog posts about consulting best practices).
- Partnerships with industry groups and communities.
- Paid search and social ads focused on long-tail consulting queries.

## Launch Plan
1. **Private Beta** with a small set of consultants and seekers to
   validate the booking and payment flow.
2. **Public Beta** once payments and ratings are stable.
3. Gather feedback, iterate, and then invest in broader marketing.

## Pricing
- Platform keeps a commission on each completed session.
- Consultants can optionally pay for promotion to appear at the top of
  search results.
- Core seeker features remain free; advanced features can become part
  of a premium tier later.

## Development Philosophy
- Keep the codebase simple and modular following KISS and SOLID.
- Aim for deployable increments every iteration to learn quickly.
- Use automated tests and CI to avoid regressions.
- Monitor feature usage to inform potential pivots or doubling down on
  a successful niche.
