# Consultant Connect MVP - User Stories

This document outlines the user stories for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## Authentication & Roles

*   **US01:** As a **New User**, I want to be able to **register** on the platform by providing my email and password, specifying whether I am an "Expert Seeker" or a "Consultant", so that I can access the platform's features specific to my role.
*   **US02:** As a **Registered User**, I want to be able to **log in** using my email and password, so that I can access my account and the platform's features.
*   **US03:** As a **Logged-in User**, I want to be able to **log out**, so that I can securely end my session.

## Consultant Profile Management

*   **US04:** As a **Consultant**, I want to be able to **create/edit my profile** including my Name, Headline, Short Bio, and Areas of Expertise (keywords/tags), so that seekers can understand my services and expertise.
*   **US05:** As a **Consultant**, I want to be able to **view my own profile page** as it appears to others, so that I can ensure it is presented correctly.

## Seeker Discovery

*   **US06:** As an **Expert Seeker**, I want to be able to **view a list/directory** of all registered consultants, showing their Name and Headline, so that I can browse available experts.
*   **US07:** As an **Expert Seeker**, I want to be able to **perform a basic keyword search** on consultant Headlines or Areas of Expertise, so that I can find consultants relevant to my needs more quickly.
*   **US08:** As an **Expert Seeker**, I want to be able to **click on a consultant** from the list/search results to view their full profile page (Name, Headline, Bio, Expertise), so that I can learn more about them before deciding to connect.

## Core Connection Mechanism

*   **US09:** As an **Expert Seeker**, I want to see a **"Request Contact" button** on a consultant's profile page, so that I can express my interest in connecting with them.
*   **US10:** As an **Expert Seeker**, when I click the "Request Contact" button on a consultant's profile, I want the **system to record my interest** (linking my profile to the consultant's), so that the platform knows I want to connect (Note: Actual notification/connection flow is deferred post-MVP).

## Prioritization (Pareto Principle - Focus on Core Value)

All the above stories (US01-US10) are considered essential for the MVP launch to validate the core user journeys of registration, profile creation, discovery, and expressing connection interest.
