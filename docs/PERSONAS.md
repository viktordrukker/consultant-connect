# User Personas

## 1. Sarah the Startup Founder (Expert Seeker)

*   **Background:** Founder of a growing B2B SaaS startup. Needs diverse expertise (marketing, tech, HR, legal) often on short notice.
*   **Needs:** Access to a wide range of vetted Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) across various fields. Quick connection and problem-solving. Reliability and trustworthiness.
*   **Pain Points:** Finds LinkedIn search results noisy and influenced by popularity over substance. Traditional networking is slow and hit-or-miss. Difficulty verifying deep expertise quickly.
*   **Goals on Platform:** Efficiently find and connect with the *right* expert for specific, often urgent, problems. Get actionable advice. Values session recaps/recordings. Wants trustworthy reviews but is open to trying newer consultants if they seem credible.
*   **Freemium View:** Expects free browsing/searching of all consultants. Willing to pay for successful sessions and potentially premium features that save time or add significant value (like recordings, enhanced support). Core discovery functionality should not be limited.

## 2. Alex the Agile Coach (Consultant)

*   **Background:** Experienced Agile Coach, recently transitioned to independent consulting. Technically proficient but building business acumen.
*   **Needs:** Generate qualified leads consistently. Fill schedule gaps efficiently. Build a professional reputation online. Secure and guaranteed payments.
*   **Pain Points:** Difficulty standing out against established players. Time consumed by marketing/sales instead of billable work. Chasing payments. Needs a platform to showcase skills effectively beyond a simple profile.
*   **Goals on Platform:** Receive a steady stream of relevant client inquiries. Minimize administrative overhead (scheduling, payments). Build credibility through successful sessions, client reviews, and potentially portfolio/case study features. Willing to invest in promotion if ROI is clear. Values payment guarantees highly.
