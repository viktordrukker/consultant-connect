**Explanation of Key Value Flows:**

1.  **Seeker to Platform:** Seekers provide monetary value by paying for successful consulting sessions.
2.  **Platform to Seeker:** The platform provides value by offering a curated pool of consultants, facilitating easy connection and scheduling, ensuring a level of trust (through profiles, reviews, payment handling), and potentially offering premium features (like recordings).
3.  **Consultant to Platform:** Consultants provide monetary value through commissions on their earnings and optional fees for premium placement/promotion. They also contribute content (profiles, expertise) which is core to the platform's offering.
4.  **Platform to Consultant:** The platform delivers value by providing access to potential clients (leads), tools to manage their online presence and reputation, administrative support (scheduling, payment processing), and the security of guaranteed payment for completed work.
5.  **Seeker to Consultant:** The seeker brings their specific need/problem and the payment for the consultant's time/expertise (facilitated securely by the platform).
6.  **Consultant to Seeker:** The consultant provides their core value â€“ expert knowledge, advice, and solutions delivered during the session.
